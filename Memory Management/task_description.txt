Create a command file that maps any 8 pages of physical memory to the
first 8 pages of virtual memory, and then reads from one virtual memory
address on each of the 64 virtual pages. Step through the simulator one
operation at a time and see if you can predict which virtual memory
addresses cause page faults. What page replacement algorithm is being
used?

Locate in the sources and describe to the instructor the page 
replacement algorithm.
